🧼 Cleaning Schedule App

A simple yet powerful CRUD web application built with Django that helps shared homes efficiently manage and rotate cleaning tasks.

🧩 Overview

The Cleaning Schedule App allows users to:

📝 Create, view, update, and delete cleaning tasks

👥 Assign tasks to house members

📅 Track progress and completed work in real time

Built with Django’s robust backend, it provides a clean, user-friendly interface for smooth task management — no more paper schedules or whiteboard magnets.

🌱 Background

When living in Japan, I stayed in a share house where cleaning duties rotated weekly — manually.
Paper schedules, magnets, and constant reminders… not the most efficient system.

So, I built this app to automate that process — turning household chaos into clean code.

“Previously: paper and magnets.
Now: clicks and automation.”
